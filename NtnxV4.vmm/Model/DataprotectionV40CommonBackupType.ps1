.SYNOPSIS

Enum DataprotectionV40CommonBackupType.

.DESCRIPTION

The backup type specifies the criteria for identifying the files to be backed up. This property should be specified to the application-consistent recovery points for Windows VMs/agents. The following backup types are supported for the application-consistent recovery points: 1. FULL_BACKUP - All files are backed up irrespective of their last backup date/time and state. Also, this backup type updates the backup history of every file that was involved in the recovery point. 2. COPY_BACKUP - All files are backed up regardless of their last backup date/time and state. However, this backup type does not update the backup history of individual files involved in the recovery point.
